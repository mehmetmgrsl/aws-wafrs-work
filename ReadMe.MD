### What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework Review (WAFR)

- Clients often seek validation of their architecture's alignment with 
   - AWS best practices, 
   - inquiring about workload adequacy, 
   - adherence to cloud best practices, and 
   - solution implementation guidance. 
   
- The AWS Well-Architected Framework addresses these concerns through its six pillars: 
   1. Operational Excellence, 
   2. Security, 
   3. Reliability, 
   4. Performance Efficiency, 
   5. Cost Optimization, and 
   6. Sustainability.


### 6 Pillars

#### 1. Cost Optimization

- Terminate unused resources
- Resize resources that are overprovisioned
- Automate shotdown on schedule

#### 2. Security

- Implement a Strong Identify Foundation
- Apply Securoty at all Layers
- Protect Data in Transit and at Rest
    - Encrypt data at rest
    - Use server-side encryption with provider managed keys
    - Encrypt data in transit
