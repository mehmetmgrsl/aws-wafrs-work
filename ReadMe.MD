### What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework Review (WAFR)

- Clients often seek validation of their architecture's alignment with 
   - AWS best practices, 
   - inquiring about workload adequacy, 
   - adherence to cloud best practices, and 
   - solution implementation guidance. 
   
- The AWS Well-Architected Framework addresses these concerns through its six pillars: 
   1. Operational Excellence, 
   2. Security, 
   3. Reliability, 
   4. Performance Efficiency, 
   5. Cost Optimization, and 
   6. Sustainability.

### Why would we need do it? (7*)

- The ultimate goal of WAFR is to improve your systems' architecture so that these systems can better support business needs.

- Process:
  1. Start reviewing the current architecture and comparing it against best practices. 
     - You do so by answering the review questions.
     - A set of questions for each pillar 
     - Identify areas in the architecture that represent high, medium or low risks â€“ More on that later
  2.  Start working on resolving the risks on a priority-based approach by identifying the highest impact of these risks
     - Create an improvement plan to address them

### Which Workloads should be reviewed? (8*)

1. Could cause damage to business reputation or revenue streams
2. Foundational Business Applications (Benefits, Payrolls etc)
3. Aggressive RPO/RTO
4. Data Security critical  
5. Time-bound event-driven workloads (i.e Seper Bowl, Oscars, etc.)


### 6 Pillars

#### 1. Operational Excelence

-  Perform operations as code
-  Make frequent, small, reversible changes
-  Refine operations procedures frequently
-  Anticipate failure
-  Learn from all operational failures

#### 2. Security

- Implement a Strong Identify Foundation
- Apply Securoty at all Layers
- Protect Data in Transit and at Rest
    - Encrypt data at rest
    - Use server-side encryption with provider managed keys
    - Encrypt data in transit


#### 3. Reliability

- The ability of a workload to perform its reqired function:
   - correctly and
   - consistently
  over an expected period of time.

To do this, design principles are:
  - Automatically recover from failure
  - Test recovery procedures
  - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
  - Stop guessing capity
  - Manage change in automation
    - using IaC (CloudFormation or Terraform)

#### 5. Cost Optimization

  - Terminate unused resources
  - Resize resources that are overprovisioned
  - Automate shutdown on schedule
